An introduction to creating a repository.

Hi World!

I am a hardware and software developer based in San Francisco Bay Area. I have an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and am currently working at Western Digital as a Senior Digital Design Engineer - creating storage for the information our brains cannot store. My interests, besides traveling, are in using the latest technology to actively shape the world, rather than be passively shaped by it. 
My current topics of interests are:

Internet of Things (IoT)
Embedded Security
Emerging technologies for computing hardware, communication, and sensing

Languages and Frameworks:
Software: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap3, Javascript, Java, C/C++
Hardware: SystemVerilog, UVM
